        "\n",
        "Answer- The __del__ method in Python, also known as a destructor, is a special method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It provides an opportunity to perform cleanup actions, such as releasing external resources or finalizing operations before the object is removed from memory. However, its behavior can be unpredictable, and its usage is generally discouraged in favor of more reliable alternatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is automatically invoked by Python's garbage collector when all references to an object have been deleted. It's important to note that the del statement in Python doesn't directly call __del__. Instead, del decrements the object's reference count, and __del__ is called later if the reference count reaches zero. Because of this, the exact timing of __del__ execution is uncertain and depends on the garbage collector's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "While __del__ can be used for cleanup tasks, it has limitations. If an exception occurs within __del__, it's silently ignored, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Also, if objects are involved in circular references, the garbage collector might not be able to break the cycle, and __del__ may not be called at all. Due to these issues, it's recommended to use context managers (with statement) or explicit cleanup methods instead of relying on __del__. These alternatives provide more control and predictability in resource management."

This is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. When a method is called on an object, Python checks the object's class to determine which implementation to execute, allowing for varied behavior based on the object's type.\n",
        "For instance, consider a base class Animal with a method speak(). Subclasses like Dog and Cat can override this method to produce different outputs. When speak() is called on a Dog object, it barks, while a Cat object meows, demonstrating polymorphism. This mechanism promotes code flexibility and reusability, as different objects can be treated uniformly while maintaining their unique behaviors."

        "Answer- The __call__ method in Python enables instances of a class to be called like regular functions. When a class implements the __call__ method, its instances become \"callable objects.\" This means you can use parentheses () to invoke the instance, and the code within the __call__ method will be executed.\n",
